by
using
coldpressed
oils
such
as
flax
canola
soybean
or
walnut
in
dressings
when
used
as
main
dishes
they
can
also
include
a
light
source
of
protein

the

industry
has
bought
a
large
soy
milk
company
pacific
soywhich
is
currently
producing
soy
milk
for

industries
they
have
asked
the
canadian

to
allow
this
soy
milk
to
be
fortified
with
b
zinc
calcium
and
vitamin
d
with
this
industry
supporting
such
a

we
are
likely
to
see
fortified
products
on

by

this

will
provide
