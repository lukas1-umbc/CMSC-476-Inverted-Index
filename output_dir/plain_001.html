recognition
of
more
than
two
decades
of
courageous
journalism

his

will
present
j
jesus
blancornelas
editor
of
the
mexican
newspaper
zeta
with
its
prestigious
international
press
freedom
award
when
blancornelas
and
longtime
colleague
hector
felix
miranda
cofounded
zeta
a
feisty
weekly
newspaper
in
the
mexicous
border
city
of
tijuana
in
they
set
a
bold
agenda
for
mexican
journalism
in
a
country
where
the
news
media
had
historically
kowtowed
to
government
interests
and
where
bribe
taking
among
journalists
was
so
commonplace
that
it
spawned
a
litany
of
catchphrases
zeta
dared
to
provide
what
few
other
mexican
newspapers
had
hardhitting
stories
on
mexicos
most
vexing
problemsofficial
corruption
and
drug
trafficking
the
cost
of
zeta
s
independence
has
been
high
felix
a
popular
columnist
known
as
felix
the
cat
whose
writing
frequently
targeted
the
wealthy
and
powerful
was
murdered
in
a
year
before
unidentified
assailants
riddled
the
zeta
office
with
bullets
and
over
the
years
the
newspaper
has
suffered
waves
of
harassment
ranging
from
confiscation
of
its
issues
to
outright
threats
to
advertisers
felixs
death
is
one
of
cases
documented
by
cpj
over
the
past
decade
of
mexican
journalists
who
were
murdered
in
apparent
reprisal
for
their
work
in
virtually
every
case
investigations
have
been
incomplete
or
contradictory
leaving
key
questions
unresolved
and

suspects
uninvestigated
zetas
drama
has
played
out
in
one
of
the
most
contentious
and
volatile
regions
of
mexico
in

was
the
first
state
in
mexico
to
elect
an
opposition
governor

of
the
centerright
national
action
party
ending
the
political
monopoly
of
the
ruling
institutional
revolutionary
party
pri
blancornelas
and
zeta
played
a
pivotal
role
in
this
historic
political
turning
point
by
providing
a
forum
for
opposition
viewpoints
and
subjecting
previous
governments
to
close
investigative
scrutiny
in
recent
years
tijuana
has
been
one
of
the
bloodiest
battlegrounds
in
mexicos
ongoing
internecine
drug
war
which
threatens
the
countrys
economic
and
political
stability
as
well
as
its
social
fabric
tijuana
was
also
the
site
in
of
mexicos
most
traumatic
political
assassination
since
the
tumultuous
aftermath
of
the
revolution
when
the
pri
presidential
candidate
luis
donaldo
colosio
was
assassinated
after
a
campaign
rally
in
the
working
class
lomas
taurino
neighborhood
despite
the
risks
blancornelas
has
not
been
deterred
largely
inspired
by
his
example
a
newly
empowered
generation
of
independent
welltrained
journalists
are
rejecting
the
old
habits
of
selfcensorship
bribetaking
and
government
subsidies
to
provide
the
mexican
public
with
more
balanced
coverage
of
the
news
in
the
spirit
of
the
international
press

awards
whose
previous
recipients
have
included
the
courageous
irish
investigative
journalist
veronica
guerin
assassinated
in

and
other
pioneers

guardians
of
a
free
press
who
have
risked
political
persecution
and
personal
hardship
cpj
is
honored
to
give
an
award
this
year
to
blancornelas
the
uphill
climb
to
establish
an
independent
voice
in
tijuana
blancornelas
and
felix
launched
zeta
soon
after
losing
control
of
another
tijuana
newspaper
abc
which
they
had
started
in
the

hallmark
was
indepth
reporting
of
government
corruption
in

the

was
taken
over
by

orchestrated
by

a
member
of

occurred
after
blancornelas
had
refused

demand
that

the

star
columnist
fearful
that
zeta
which
picked
up
where
abc
left
off
would
be
a
target
of
government
reprisal
blancornelas
decided
to
edit
and
publish
the
paper
from
san
diego
for
a
couple
of
years
to
avoid
a
shutdown
by
mexican
authorities
who
controlled
a
newsprint
monopoly

street
outrage
followed
his
murder
thousands
attended
the
funeral
and
an
unusual
alliance
of
tijuana
journalists
and
political
officials
demanded
justice
they
would
not
allow
this
murder
to
be
left
unsolved
as
had
those
of
many
other
mexican
journalists
two
employees
of
a
tijuana
racetrack
owned
by
the
son
of
a
powerful
pri
politician
and
power
broker
were
eventually
convicted
of
the
shooting
and
they
are
currently
serving
prison
sentences
but
authorities
never
established
a
motive
for
the
assassination
and
it
is
widely
believed
the
intellectual
authors
remain
at
large
in
the
wake
of
felixs
murder
blancornelas
continued
to
print
his
colleagues
name
on
the
masthead
of

and
in
each

reproduced
one
of

columns
opposite
a

in
the
year
following

murder
several
journalists
found
their
careers
threatened
when
they
criticized
how
the
case
was
being
handled
five
reporters
were
fired
from
the
daily
el

after
they
published
a
special

critical
of

after
opening
their

critical
of

investigation
and
other
journalists
said
they
felt
subtle
pressures
to
tone
down
coverage
of
the
case
blancornelas
sets
precedent
for
mexican
journalists
fighting
government
control
of
press
with
both
abc
and
zeta
blancornelas
insisted
that
his
newspapers
not
be
beholden
to
anyone
in
an
effort
to
bypass
one
of
the
most
onerous
government
controls
over
the
pressa
requirement
that
all
newsprint
be
purchased
directly
from
the
mexican
governments
newsprint
monopoly
blancornelas
went
to
san
diego
in
and
there
printed
zeta
and
exported
it
to
tijuana
according
to
blancornelas
mexican
authorities
could
not
block
zeta
s
import
because
they
would
have
been
forced
to
do
the
same
with
us
publications
entering
the
country
in
mexican
president
carlos
salinas
decided
to
sell
the
newsprint
monopoly
enabling
newspapers
to
buy
newsprint
directly
from
foreign
manufacturers
but
the
lingering
fear
of
government
interference
remains
and
some
mexican
newspapers
have
opted
to
publish
on
the
us
side
of
the
border
newspapers
in
hermosillo
sonora
for
instance
are
printed
in
tucson
arizona
and
some
papers
in
ciudad
juarez
chihuahua
are
printed
in
el
paso
texas
blancornelas
has
also
been
an
inspiring
figure
for
those
mexican
journalists
eager
to
break
the
bribetaking
habits
of
their
predecessors
as
late
as
it
was
still
common
practice
for
reporters
editors
and
columnists
to
take
money
from
elected
officials
government
bureaucrats
and
businessmen
in
exchange
for
flattering
profiles
or
uncritical
coverage
from
zeta
s
founding
in
blancornelas
made
the
papers
policy
clear
bribe
taking
is
unacceptable
the
slightest
suspicion
of
bribetaking
is
cause
for
dismissal
blancornelas
says
and
to
date
no
cases
have
come
to
light
journalists
make
good
money
here
they
dont
need
it
bribes
he
said
zeta
s
example
has
helped
bring
about
a
sea
change
in
the
way
mexican
journalists
do
business
and
how
they
view
their
role
in
baja
california
gov
ruffo
prohibited
state
officials
from
offering
government
bribes
to
journalists
former
mexican
president
carlos

de
gortari
enacted
a
similar
policy
among
his
cabinet
as
a
result
says

no

recourse
