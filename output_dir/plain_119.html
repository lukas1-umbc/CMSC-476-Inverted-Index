revolution
by

ere
many
generations
pass
our
machinery
will
be
driven
by
a
power
obtainable
at
any

jeane
manning
canadian
author
of
the
coming
energy
revolutionthe
search
for
free
energy
strongly
agrees
with
nicola
teslas
prediction
and
in
fact
envisions
that
production
models
of
free
energy
devices
are
just
around
the
corner
on
the
cover
of
her
new
book
manning
states
there
is
a
new
and
exciting
revolution
coming
it
will
dramatically
change
our
landscape
our
environment
our
economy
and
our
lives
it
will
provide
each
and
every
one
of
us
with
a
truly
unique
sense
of
independence
it
will
mark
the
end
of
oil
influenced
politics
and
the
beginning
of
a
bright
new
millenniuma
time
in
which
we
will
all
have
our
own
unlimited
sources
of
nonpolluting
energy
which
will
power
our
vehicles
heat
our
homes
and
light
up
our
lives
however
it
will
not
come
without
a
struggle
as
history
has
already
shown
jeane
manning
is
a
freelance
journalist
who
since
has
traveled
throughout
north
america
and
europe
to
both
study
and
report
on
newenergy
technologies
her
articles
and
essays
have
appeared
in
numerous
energy
journals
as
well
as
several
books
she
has
worked
as
a
newspaper
reporter
and
editor
raised
three
children
and
now
resides
in
vancouver
bc
what
made
her
step
off
a
safe
career
ladder
ten
years
ago
and
into
the
uncertainty
of
researching
the
nonconventional
free
energy
movement
i
was
living
in
vernon
bc
and
heard
about
an
inventor
in
penticton
who
invented
an
extraordinary
magnetic
dynamo
he
named
his
company
pran
tech
because
he
believed
that
powerful
magnets
somehow
suck
in
the
pranaa
subtle
energy
recognized
by
the
ancientsfrom
the
air
around
us
using
a
super
efficient
arrangement
of
permanent
magnets
and
electrical
coils
he
claimed
the
machine
when
fully
developed
would
put
out
more
electricity
than
it
took
to
run
it
i
didnt
understand
the
technical
explanations
at
the
time
but
i
was
convinced
that
he
sincerely
wanted
to
help
clean
up
the
planet
with
a
pollutionfree
energy
source
i
thought
if
this
is
real
we
wont
need
to
dam
any
more
wild
rivers
or
poison
the
air
if
it
is
bona
fide
then
as
a
journalist
i
want
to
spread
the
word
about
it
when
the
time
is
right
fifteen
years
later
the
time
was
right
the
coming
energy
revolution
published
in
covers
the
history
of
free
energy
research
explains
the
conceptual
basis
of
this
new
technology
and
introduces
us
to
some
of
the
inventors
their
struggles
failures
and
successes
mannings
research
has
placed
her
in
the
middle
of
an
international
subculture
that
isexcuse
the
punelectric
with
excitement
over
recent
developments
in
nonconventional
energy
alternatives
the
scene
is
no
longer
filled
with
garage
inventors
and
mad
scientists
instead
a
small
but
increasing
number
of
serious
researchers
with
phds
in
physics
or
engineering
is
convinced
that
mainstream
science
texts
will
have
to
be
rewritten
some
of
these
people
publish
articles
in
respected
physics
journals
explaining
that
the
zeropoint
quantum
fluctuations
of
the
vacuum
of
space
could
be
cohered
into
a
usable
energy
source
free
energy
is
a
misnomer
manning
points
out
because
there
is
a
cost
associated
with
building
machines
to
generate
electrical
energy
even
if
the
nonconventional
machines
need
no
fuel
to
operate
however
the
phrase
caught
the
imagination
of
many
people
over
the
years
and
is
now
used
in
some
circles
as
a
slogan
with
free
as
a
verb
lets
free
energy
todays
energy
researchers
such
as
hal
fox
phd
of
salt
lake
city
prefer
terms
such
as
space
energy
to
describe
the
incredible
amounts
of
power
available
in
the
socalled
vacuum
of
space
around
us
respected
theorists
say
there
is
enough
potential
energy
in
the
vacuum
in
a
light
bulb
to
boil
all
the
worlds
oceans
if
it
could
be
put
to
use
newenergy
theorists
want
to
use
only
a
trickle
of
that
energy
to
give
the
world
a
clean
source
of
power
as
with
the
personal
computer
revolution
years
ago
inventors
are
making
breakthroughs
in
home
workshops
and
garages
as
well
as
private
laboratories
observers
of
the
science
underground
predict
that
this
revolution
will
have
even
more
of
an
impact
on
society
than
pcs
have
had
it
could
do
more
than
transform
our
homes
vehicles
and
factories
it
will
also
provide
a
means
to
clean
up
rivers
as
well
as
the
air
and
soils
scrutiny
of
the
emerging
energy
field
reveals
a
complex
picture
with
dark
areas
of
greed
corporate
lobbying
international
energy
politics
bureaucratic
inertia
academic
resistance
secrecy
and
inventors
paranoia
however
the
bright
spots
of
irrepressible
new
discoveries
are
growing
increasingly
faster
and
are
showing
up
in
unexpected
places
cooperative
efforts
may
win
out
as
leadingedge
scientists
and
many
independent
innovators
from
about
countries
now
are
working
towards
the
same
goal
manning
has
covered
recent
developments
in
free
energy
technology
for
instance
cold
fusion
has
been
successfully
repeated
and
japan
for
one
is
investing
millions
of
dollars
into
cold
fusion
research
other
water
fuel
cell
technologies
hold
promise
for
cleaning
up
the
atmosphere
as
they
power
vehicles
revolutionary
advances
towards
clean
abundant
power
also
use
sunshine
and
heat
in
the
air
or
in
the
ground
to
make
electricity
through
superefficient
solar
photovoltaics
or
advancedconcept
heat
pumps
a
canadian
company
has
developed
efficient
smallscale
generators
which
revolve
in
a
stream
of
water
or
in
ocean
tides
without
harming
marine
life
a
variety
of
prototype
zeropoint
vacuum
energy
devices
apparently
tap
the
energy
in
space
they
include
magnetic
electrostatic
electrodynamic
and
solidstate
ways
to
generate
electricity
except
for
the
initial
cost
of
equipment
and
minimal
maintenance
the
expected
result
will
be
costfree
electricity
generators
that
access
this
energy
are
now
operating
making
it
likely
that
within
the
next
decade
new
energy
production
methods
will
take
energy
out
of
the
air
with
no
negative
byproducts
changes
manning
claims
we
can
look
forward
to
in
the
near
future
include
no
longer
having
to
pay
a
utility
bill
or
buy
gasoline
and
so
being
able
to
leasepurchase
the
energy
converter
after
the
hardware
is
paid
for
the
electrical

you
use

to

which
other
academics
have
ignored
up
to
now
he
now
lives
the
challenging
life
of
an
author
and
independent
scientist
he
says
because
the
free
energy
that
surrounds
us
is
such
a
vast
resource
so
potentially
clean
and
decentralized
some
of
us
believe
an
energy
revolution
is
imminent
afterward
existing
energy
sources
may
be
seen
as
dinosaur
nightmares
that
littered
our
landscape
and
polluted
our
air
this
revolution
could
open
a
new
paradigm
of
science
and
technology
that
would
make
the
copernican
and
industrial
revolutions
appear
tame
redirecting
trillion
per
year
from
obsolete
power
systems
to
sustainable
and
affordable
systems
is
an
unprecedented
change
with
vast
possibilities
a
switch
to
clean
free
energy
could
almost
totally
alleviate
air
pollution
global

from
carbon

emissions

manning
says
the
energy
revolution
could
affect
peoples
livestheir
practical
everyday
choicesprofoundly
because
decentralized
power
means
freedom
it
means
empowerment
to
clean
up
our
environment
instead
of
feeling
helpless
the
megaprojectbuilders
will
no
longer
have
a
leg
to
stand
on
when
they
claim
their
projects
are
necessary
people
have
to
take
back
their
power
at
the
individual
and
local
level
it
wont
be
handed
back
in
an
envelope
from
the
government
the
tax
structure
as
well
as
electric
utilities
will
need
to
be
changed
because
of
all
the
energy
related
tentacles
that
stretch
out
from
capital
cities
and
from
financial
centers
like
wall
street
and
reach
into
