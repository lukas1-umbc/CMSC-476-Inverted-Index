journal
published
a
study
showing
that
while
the
company
excelled
in
a
number
of
important
areas
it
had
virtually
no
image
of
community
service
the
client
was
especially
concerned
with
positive
public
recognition
at
that
time
as
they
were
about
to
go
public
and
the
owners
were
trying
to
presell
blocks
of
stock
to
institutional
investors
the
company
had
regional
locations
representing
nearly
retail

they
needed
a
pr

that
would
work
well
from
coast

coast
to
save
costs
the

also
had
to
give
each
of

their
generous

was
amply
rewarded

sent
the

more
than
personal
letters
of

perhaps
more
significant
were
the

sent
by

congressional
representatives
governors

state
