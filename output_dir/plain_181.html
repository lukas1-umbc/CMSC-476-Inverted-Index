sees

the

be

like
in

this
is
to
say
that
will
be
another

of
recordsetting

heightened

and
rapid

for

according
to
vanston
president
of
austin
texasbased
consultants
technology
futures
inc
vanston
and
other
observers
surveyed
by
wbf
said
it
may
well
be
that
the
industry
is
in
for
a
year
when
the
pace
of
developments
if
anything
gains
more
momentum
such
an
acceleration
is
seen
occurring
across
a
broad
frontmanifested
by
prices
for
services
driven
lower
as
more
competitors
arrive
on
the
scene
and
by
a
stream
of
technological
advancesand
against
a
backdrop
where
wireless
telephony
becomes
a
widespread
reality
in
more
markets
overseas
but
this
is
not
to
say
that
there
are
no
clouds
on
the
wireless
horizon
indeed
renewed
signs
of
a
slowdown
in

worlds

in

dampened
the

that
sent
the

american

tumbling

the
second

in

page
however
it
was
unclear
at
press
time
whether
handset
manufacturers
in
general
faced
a
repeat
of
the
overages
that
built
up
in
their
us
inventories
during
the
christmas
season
all
the
same
wall
streeters
are
a
notoriously
fickle
bunch
and
any
falloff
in
domestic
wireless
growth
should
be
measured
against
the
blistering
expansion
that
the
us
market
enjoyed
during
and
the
first
half
of
net
subscriber
additions
simply
could
not
be
sustained
forever
at
such
an
explosive

span
all
eyes
turn
to

big
changes
are
destined
to
sweep
the
us
wireless
market
this
year
as
the
industry
comes
to
grips
with
the
probable
enactment
of
legislation
aimed
at
deregulating
telecommunications
this
would
give
network
operators
the
statutory
certainty
they
need
to
move
forward
with
big
purchases
of
new

said
matthew

competition
consolidation

more
of

perhaps
the
most

before

is
how
to
compete
effectively
on
a
landscape
that
seemingly
keeps
shifting
beneath
its
feet
for
many
wireless

achieving

is
the
way
to
maximize
their

this

has
been
most
pronounced

lack
of
handsets
seen
impeding
dualband
gsm
services
cellular
operators
that
employ
global
system
for
mobile
communications
gsm
technology
in
their
networks
should
think
long
and
hard
about
pairing
their
services
with
gsms
higherfrequency
counterparts
dcs
and
pcs
so
says
toni
stadelmann
deputy
managing
director
of
mobile
services
for
swiss
telecom
which
has
deployed
a
dcs
personal
communications
network
pcn
in
geneva
to
go
with
its
nationwide
gsm
cellular
network
while
its
experience
with
pcn
has
been
limited
the
geneva
system
was
rolled
out
to
coincide
with
the
telecom
trade
show
and
conference
last
octoberthe
ptt
plans
to
introduce
dcs
service
in
zurich
and
basel
next
fall
as
a

supplement
to

in
these
hightraffic
markets
stadelmann
told
the
pcs
in
north
america
conference
in
washington
last
month
in
the
long
run
he
said
the
company
hopes
to
reach
roaming
agreements
that
would
tie
its
pcn
service
together
with
europes
gsm
cellular
operators
and
countries
that
either
have
pcn
alreadythe
united
kingdom
germany
and
franceor
are
contemplating
pcn
rollouts
including
sweden
and
italy
but
there
is
one
sizable
problem
wireless
equipment
manufacturers
need
to
speed
up
efforts
to
bring
dualband
mobile
phones
to
market
the
subject
of
gsmdcs
handsets
also
came
up
during
another
recent
meeting
in
washington
i
dont
know
of
any
vendor
today
committed
to
developing
these
handsets
malcolm
cowan
general
manager
of
the
richardson
texasbased
pcs
business
unit
of
northern
telecom
ltd
told
the
pcs
strategies
conference
if
recent
contract
announcements
are
any
indication
however
finlands
nokia
corp
may
be
the
first
to
take
the
plunge
the
company
has
signed
a
twoyear
contract
with
telia
mobitel
the
biggest
gsm
cellular
network
in
sweden
for
the
delivery
of
base
station
subsystems
that
can
be
used
either
for
a
standalone
dcs
network
or
a
seamless
dualband
service
the
base
stations
are
designed
to
bolster
capacity
in
areas
with
heavy
calling
traffic
as
well
as
to
improve
indoor
coverage
savings
on
fixed
and
operating
costs
more
flexibility
in
setting
rates
nokias
other
recent
gsmdcs
infrastructure
deals
were
with
nordictel
holdings
of
sweden
and
sonofon
of
denmark
it
also
was
the
vendor
for
swiss
telecoms
dcs
system
for
swiss
telecomscheduled
to
face
competition
in
pcn
beginning
in
when
spectrum
set
aside
for
private
operators
will
be
opened
uppairing
gsm
and
dcs
will
afford
cost
advantages
in
the
areas
of
infrastructure
its
transmission
network
and
customer
service
and
billing
stadelmann
said
according
to
an
analysis
in
which
the
ptt
assigned
different
weightings
to
these
cost
areas
potential
savings
of
percent
can
be
had
percent
on
both
transmission
network
and
billingcustomer
service
expenses
and
another
percent
on
infrastructure
costs
moreover
in
limiting
its
pcn
coverage
to
urban
areas
stadelmann
said
that
swiss
telecom
has
found
that
it
can
devise
a
rate
structure
that
offers
greater
appeal
to
the
more
priceconscious
segment
of
the
wireless
voice
market
by
setting
rates
close
to
those
of
the
wireline
network
swiss
telecom
hopes
to
induce
customers
to
switch
over
to
pcn
from
the
fixed
network
for
the
mobility
it
affords
but
that
of
course
first
would
require
a
more
robust
roaming
capability
all
stadelmann
could
do
last
month
was
ask
rhetorically
what
are
the
manufacturers
doing
he
would
like
to
see
action
sooner
rather
than
later
