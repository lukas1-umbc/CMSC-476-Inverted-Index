science
objectives
sircxsars
unique
contributions
to
earth
observation
and
monitoring
are
its
capability
to
measure
from
space
the
radar
signature
of
the
surface
at
three
different
wavelengths
and
to
make
measurements
for
different
polarizations
at
two
of
those
wavelengths
sirc

data
will
help
scientists
understand
the
physics
behind
some
of
the
phenomena
seen
in
radar
images
at
just
one
wavelengthpolarization
such
as
those
produced
by
seasat
investigators
on
the
sircxsar
science
team
will
use
the

sircxsar
instrument
description
the
sircxsar
antenna
structure
actually
consists
of
three
individual
antennas
one
operating
at
lband
cm
wavelength
one
at
cband
cm
wavelength
and
the
third
at
xband
cm
wavelength
the
lband
and
cband
antennas
are
constructed
from
separate
panels
that
can
measure
both
horizontal
and
vertical
polarizations
the
sircxsar
antenna
is
the
most
massive
piece
of
hardware
at
a
total
of
kilograms
ever
assembled
at
the
jet
propulsion
laboratory
and
measures
meters
by
meters
the
sirc
instrument
was
built
by
jpl
and
the
ball
communication
systems
division
for
nasa
and
provides
the
lband
and
cband
measurements
at
different
polarizations
the
lband
and
cband
antennas
employ
phased
array
technology
which
allows
the
antenna
beam
pointing
to
be
adjusted
electronically
the
xsar
instrument
is
built
by
the
dornier
and
alenia
spazio
companies
for
dara
and
asi
and
operates
at
a
single
frequency
xband
the
xsar
antenna
is
a
slotted
waveguide
type
which
uses
a
mechanical
tilt
to
change
the
beam
pointing
direction
sircxsar
image
data
during
a
weeklong
shuttle
flight
sircxsar
will
image
an
area
of
roughly
million
square
kilometers
of
the
earths
surface
this
corresponds
to
a
total
of
hours
of
data
the
peak
data
rate
will
be
megabits
or
bits
per
second
the
data
collected
will
be
processed
into
images
with
resolution
selectable
from
to
meters
the
width
of
the
area
mapped
out
by
the
radar
will
vary
from
to
kilometers
depending
on
how
the
radar
is
operated
and
the
direction
in
which
the
antenna
beams
are
pointing
data
from
sircxsar
will
be
used
to
develop
automatic
techniques
for
extracting
information
from
radar
image
data
in
preparation
for
the
eos
sar
mission
later
in
the
decade
this

the
sircxsar
antennas
illuminating
an
area
on
the

sircxsar
is
a

between
the
national

nasa
the
german

the

that
began
with

continued
with

will
eventually
lead

to

globally
and

later
in

the

also
benefits
from

gained
with
the

programs
eg

such

sirc
will
provide
increased
capability
over
seasat
sira
and
sirb
by
acquiring
digital
images
simultaneously
at
two
microwave
wavelengths
lambda
l
band
lambda
cm
and
cband
lambda
cm
these
vertically
and
horizontallypolarized
transmitted
waves
will
be
received
on
two
separate
channels
so
that
sirc
will
provide
images
of
the
magnitude
of
radar
backscatter
for
four
polarization
combinations
hh

hv
and

and
also
data
on
the
relative

between

this
allows
derivation
of
the
complete
scattering
matrix
of
a
scene
on
a
pixel
by

basis
from
this
scattering
matrix
every
polarization
configuration
linear
circular
or
elliptical
can
be
generated
during
ground
processing
the
radar
polarimetric
data
will
yield
more
detailed
information
about
the

germanys

program
started
with
the

experiment
mrse
flown
aboard
the
shuttle
this
xband
radar
was
flown
on
the
first
spacelab
mission
in
the
program
was
continued
by
development
of
the
xsar
for
which
cooperation
with
italy
was
initiated
xsar
will
operate
at
xband
lambda
cm
with
vv
polarization
resulting
in
a
three
frequency
capability
for
the
total
sircxsar
system
because
radar
backscatter
is
most
strongly
influenced
by
objects
comparable
in
size
to
the
radar
wavelength
this
multifrequency
capability
will
provide
information
about
the
earths
surface
over
a
wide
range
of
scales
not
discernible
with
previous
singlewavelength
experiments
sircxsar

sirc
will
provide
multifrequency

radar
data
the
sirc
instrument
is
composed
of
several
subsystems
the
antenna
array
the
transmitter
the
receivers
the
datahandling
subsystem
and
the
ground
sar
processor
the
antenna
is
composed
of
two
planar
arrays
one
for
lband
and
one
for
cband
each
array
is
composed
of
a
uniform
grid
of
dualpolarized
microstrip
antenna
radiators
with
each
polarization
port
fed
by
a
separate
corporate
feed
network
the
overall
size
of
the
sirc
antenna
is
x
meters
and
consists
of
three
leaves
each
divided
into
four
subpanels
model
of
the
sircxsar
antenna
unlike
previous
sir
missions
the
sirc
radar
beam
is
formed
from
hundreds
of
small
low
power
solid
state
transmitters
embedded
in
the
surface
of
the
radar
antenna
by
properly
phasing
the
energy
from
these
transmitters
the

can
be
electronically
steered
in
the

direction
deg
from
the
nominal
deg
off
nadir
position
without

the
large

this
feature
will
enable

to
be
acquired
over
a
wide
range
of

angles
xsar
will

include
a

a

mechanism
will
point
the
xsar
antenna
to
angles
between

deg
in
the
same
direction
as
the
lband

both
sirc

xsar
can
be
operated
as
either
stand
alone
radars
